Here is an [article](https://medium.com/building-the-system/gunicorn-3-means-of-concurrency-efbb547674b7)\n",
    "    - What mainly catches my eye here as an option for parallel computing within the server is the “workers” parameter. The workers are the number of processes actually loading the application, so if there are multiple workers, there can be multiple processes loading the app in a parallel fashion. According to the article, something that I did not notice as a parallel computing process is the number of threads. This is a parameter that is not a part of the above command, but can be added.\n",

It is imported as a separate python module, and when testing the running of certain programs, the processing time was significantly less (albeit for the programs tested in the article, it was a very minimal difference of 2-3 seconds), but can be much more significant if being compared for larger data sets in programs.\n",
