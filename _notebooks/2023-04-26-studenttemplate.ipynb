    "## Lists\n",
    "- What are Lists?\n",
    "    - Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable\n",
    "    - Unlike dictionaries, lists' keys are all integers that describe the order of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some examples of lists:\n",
    "    -  Playlist of songs\n",
    "    -  names of students in a class\n",
    "    -  contacts on your phone\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1.\n",
    "    - AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc.\n",
    "    - Python:  0,1,2,3 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do lists Manage Complexity of a program?**\n",
    "- We may not need as many variables. For example:\n",
    "    - One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student\n",
    "    - There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time"
