This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application's performance.\n",

    "- Inheritance and method overriding\n",

Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier.\n",
