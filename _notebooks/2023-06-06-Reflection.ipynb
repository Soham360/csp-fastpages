    "# Skills I have obtained\n",
    "I learned many different skills while in APCSP. The most obvious skill is coding. I had a little bit of python experience because I was in the Oak Valley Coding Club in middle school, but I had forgotten most of it by the start of this school year. The first trimester was like a refresher for me and I mainly regained all of the programming knowledge I had forgotten. There were a lot of differences in what I learned in middle school and what I learned in APCSP. First of all, OVCC, we did all our work in PyCharm. It is a code editor created specifically for Python Projects and was good, but lacked a lot of the useful features VSCode has to offer. Another difference is that in APCSP, we used Github. I learned about Github and its usefulness when saving/sharing code. I also learned about Github Pages and Fastpages. These tools allowed me to create my own website for free and is very useful. Finally, I learned about a lot of other languages other than Python such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SASS. HTML and Javascript allowed me to create objects on the frontend that you could interact with. "
