## Hack Questions
Hack Questions
1. My group setup is not strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests because we did not know each other before but now have become friends.
2. My group setup is with diversity because we all have varying computer science levels. We also have diverse backgrounds: Puneri, Marathi, Persian, and mixed Hispanic.
3. My group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classrooms because we can work together very well.
