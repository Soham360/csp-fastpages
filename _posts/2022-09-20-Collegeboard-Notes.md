Essential Knowledge
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives
- Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents

## How to collaborate in class
Pair Programming
- Two programmers work together as a pair. One (driver)writes program code, while the other (observer, pointer, navigator) reviews each line of program code
Think-Pair-Share
- Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class

## Hack Questions
Hack Questions
1. My group setup is not strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests because we did not know each other before but now have become friends.
2. My group setup is with diversity because we all have varying computer science levels. We have a diverse backgrounds: Puneri, Marathi, Persian, and mixed Hispanic.
3. My group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classrooms because we can work together very well.
