## Why is collaboration important?
- Collaboration improves interpersonal skills
- Computing innovations are improved through collaboration

---

## Benefits of collaboration
Computing innovations
- Effective collaboration produces innovations that reflect the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it
- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias when developing computing innovations

---

## What are computing innovations
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- A computing innovation can be physical (self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e-commerce).

## Collaboration in AP CSP
Essential Knowledge
- Consultation and communcation with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration

## How to collaborate in class
Pair Programming
- Two programmers work together as a pair. One (driver)writes program code, while the other (oberserver, pointer, navigator) reviews each line of program code
Think-Pair-Share
- Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class

---

## Purpose of comments in code
- Communicate to you partner(s)
- Communicate to yourself
- Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
- Acknowledge media used from other sources
- Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did
- Clarify the functionality of your code

---

## Online collaboration tools for class
- Repl.it - multiplayer, multiple languages
- GitHub - collaboration and repository

## Hack Questions
Hack Questions
1. My group setup is not strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests because we did not know each other before but now have become friends.
2. My group setup is with diversity because we all have varying computer science levels. We have a diverse backgrounds: Puneri, Marathi, Persian, and mixed Hispanic.
3. My group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classrooms because we can work together very well.
