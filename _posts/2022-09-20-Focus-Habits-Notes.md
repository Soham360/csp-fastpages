Note of Gratitude
I made 2 notes of gratitudes, one to my friend and one to my parents. For the note to my friend, I thanked him for always being my friend and always supporting me through rough times. He was very grateful for the note and that was that. For the note to my parents, I thanked them for helping me become who I am today. They were also very grateful for my note and were happy of the person I am today.
