# Crowdsourcing
The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more likely you will reduce Computer Bias.  Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.

### Evidence of Crowdsourcing
* Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see [Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).  It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community.  Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than "official" information.
* Crypto currency and associated block chain.  All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners.  If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again.  Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency.   Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records).
* COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing.   This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks.  The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives.  


### Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing (Crossover Group Up, ~10 minutes)
1. We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API's, namely RapidAPI.  This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.
    - Some APIs that I have used are a recipe API and a Hangman API used for the words in hangman.
2. We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub.  Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students.  Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history.  What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
    - The biggest discovery I have found in GitHub is the ability to wget files and fork entire repositories extremely quickly. This is really cool because it allows the sharing of code and allows people to build off of other people's work.
3. [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for code and science exploration.  The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels.  Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions.  Exam top 10 to 20.  Did you see anything interesting?
    - I noticed that if you sort by most votes, "Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog" is in first place and has almost triple the amount of votes as second place.
    - I noticed that 2 of the top 20 datasets are related to Covid


### Hacks 
> Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project ...
1. CompSci has 150 ish principles students.  Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
    - Using emoji reactions in Slack can be an effective crowdsourcing method for CSP students. The emoji reactions allow students to quickly and easily provide feedback on specific posts or topics in the Slack channel. This can provide valuable insight and input from the students, helping to improve the course and enhance the learning experience. Additionally, Slack's real-time communication capabilities allow for immediate feedback and engagement, making it a useful tool for crowdsourcing in an educational setting.
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing?  Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
    - Using Instagram polls is a good way to crowdsource feedback for a project, especially if the target audience is familiar with and accessible through the platform. Instagram polls allow you to quickly gather input from a large group of people in real-time, making it an efficient method for gathering feedback. By testing certain features with groups of people and receiving feedback through polls, you can gather valuable information about the user experience and make informed decisions about your project.
3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting?  Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
    - Collecting ratings on a scale of 1-10 is a simple and effective way to gather feedback and gauge the popularity and overall perception of your website or project. This type of rating system provides a quick and straightforward method for collecting data and can provide valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your site. You can use this information to make informed decisions about the direction of your project and to identify areas for improvement.
