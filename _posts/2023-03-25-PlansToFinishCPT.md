# My Plan
- As of 3/27/23, my program to review recipes has all aspects of CRUD.
- Frontend
    -  From here, I plan to make my CPT visually different from my teammates to show that my CPT is different. This means I will have to change a lot of the frontend to be able to make this change.
- Backend
    - I plan to make a sorting function using pandas or something similar so I can display the reviews for the recipe you clicked on instead of displaying all of the reviews for all of the recipes below the input section.
    - I want the reviews to be displayed in chronological order starting from the oldest to the newest. This should be easy as when a new entry is added to a database.
    - I also want to be able to click on the columns and be able to sort the reviews chronologically and alphabetically. The first click should sort it from newest to oldest. The second click should sort them from A-Z and the third click should sort them from Z-A. The fourth click should return it back to chronological order from oldest to newest.
