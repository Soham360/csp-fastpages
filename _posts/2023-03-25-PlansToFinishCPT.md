# My Plan
As of 3/27/23, my program to review recipes has all aspects of CRUD. From here, I plan to make my CPT visually different from my teammates to show that my CPT is different. This means I will have to change a lot of the frontend to be able to make this change. I also plan to make a sorting function using pandas or something similar so I can display the reviews for the recipe you clicked on instead of displaying all of the reviews for all of the recipes below the input section.
