# My Notes and Takeaways from the CSUSM presentation
## Campus and Classes
- CSU San Marcos has an amazing physics program. I'm very interested in physics so if I end up going to this University, I would love to take this course.
- The school isn't that big so there is a closer connection between students and teachers.
- Many engineering buildings have been built and there are plans to build a new Biology lab soon.
- There are many CTE pathways present at CSUSM
    - Computer Engineering, Applied Physics, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, etc.
- There are many departments as well: 
    - Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Biological Sciences, Math, Computer Science, etc.
- Many STEM clubs active in campus - Cybersecurity Club, Robotics, 3D Printing, Women in STEM, etc.
- Fun Fact 1: The land that CSUSM is built on used to belong to a poultry farm.
- Fun Fact 2: Over 250 stairs are at the campus

## Internships
Internships are jobs, sometimes, unpaid, to earn work experience in a certain field. How to find internships:
- Attend school events to learn where to find internship opportunities
    - Also a great way to make connections with other people
- Search online for internship opportunities
- Check email often because it has reminders for important events
- Since I want to pursue a career in STEM, I would have to find a STEM-related company to intern at to gain professional work experience.

## Takeaways
This opportunity provided me with details regarding CSUSM's diverse selection of classes and departments, as well as the numerous opportunities available to students. Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights into topics such as scholarships, grants, loans, and internships, and received practical advice on navigating the college application process. Additionally, I was able to narrow down my interests and preferences, allowing me to identify potential college majors and pathways that align with my goals. To top it off, the hands-on electrical engineering activity we participated in at the end of the class was both enjoyable and interesting, sparking a newfound interest in this exciting field.
