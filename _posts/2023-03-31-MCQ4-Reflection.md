For this question, you were supposed to determine what additional piece of information would be most useful to determine the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month. I mistakenly chose Option D because I thought that if an artist sells more food and drinks during their show, this would mean that they have a greater attendance due to a lot more money earned through sales. The correct answer is Option A because if you divide the total dollar amount of all tickets sold by the average ticket price, you would get the total number of attendees.

For this question, you were supposed to answer that sequence of steps would lead the the desired entry. I correctly answer Option B but incorrectly answer Option C. This because I misread the answer and I mistakenly answered "Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer" instead of "Sort by subject, then filter by year, then filter by photographer". I knew the answer, I just selected the wrong option. This is why the answer is Option D.

# MCQ4 Reflection
I know that I could have gotten a perfect score on this quiz but I just misread a couple questions and got them wrong. If I just focus on what the question is asking and what I'm answering, I know that I could have gotten a 25/25. Next time, I'll do my best to focus on the questions and answers and get the perfect score.
