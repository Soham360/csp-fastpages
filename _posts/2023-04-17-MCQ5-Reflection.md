For this question, you were supposed to determine the ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program. I answered Option A and Option C. Option A was correct but unfortunately, Option C was incorrect. I answered this because it was a difficult question. I knew it could not be Option B because replacing longer variable names with shorter variable names to reduce typing errors seemed like an edge-case issue. This meant the last answer must be Option C or Option D. I answered Option C because it seemed more broad and I thought it included Option D in it. This is why I answered this. I realize now that Option D is correct because creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

I got 65/66 on this quiz and I'm really happy. I've improved a lot since the last MCQ and even though, this MCQ had a lot more questions, I only got 1 wrong this time compared to my 5 mistakes last quiz. I thought this MCQ was really easy and I feel like my preparations really helped me with this quiz. I am so proud and I hope to do as well next quiz.
