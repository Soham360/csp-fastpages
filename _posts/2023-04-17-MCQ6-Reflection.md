For this question, you were supposed to determine the ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program. I answered Option A and Option C. Option A was correct but unfortunately, Option C was incorrect. I answered this because it was a difficult question. I knew it could not be Option B because replacing longer variable names with shorter variable names to reduce typing errors seemed like an edge-case issue. This meant the last answer must be Option C or Option D. I answered Option C because it seemed more broad and I thought it included Option D in it. This is why I answered this. I realize now that Option D is correct because creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

I'm really happy about my quiz result - got 65 out of 67! I did a lot better than my previous attempt at a multiple-choice questionnaire. This time, there were more questions, but I only got one wrong. Last time, I had messed up five answers. I found this quiz pretty easy and I think my preparations paid off. I'm proud of myself and hope to do just as well in the next one.
