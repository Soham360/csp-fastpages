# MCQ7 Reflection
I'm really happy about my quiz result - got 65 out of 67! I did a lot better than my previous attempt at a multiple-choice questionnaire. This time, there were more questions, but I only got one wrong. Last time, I had messed up five answers. I found this quiz pretty easy and I think my preparations paid off. I'm proud of myself and hope to do just as well in the next one.
