## Night At The Museum
Night at the Museum is typically held near the end of the trimester, and it serves as a platform for students in art and craft classes to display their final projects. Among the classes that participate in this event are 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, APCSP, and APCSA. Computer Science students present their final projects in teams, while Drawing and Painting students showcase their best art pieces. Students in 3D Animation display their digital artwork, while Ceramics students exhibit their sculptures. I found this event to be particularly enjoyable because it allowed me to view the creative works of my friends in their respective classes, as well as showcase my own. The caliber of the projects was impressive, with many of them showcasing exceptional creativity.

I'm actually in this class right now and we use a program called Blender to help us create the objects in the pictures. You can create anything in Blender and the only limit is your imagination!

I was really impressed by all of the art that the students created. I know I would never be able to create such amazing pieces. I was really blown away by the piece above. It was about a foot tall and was very detailed.

Ceramics seems like a really easy art to do but I know it really isn't. It incredible how they are able to use rough, gray or brown clay, and create such colorful, shiny, sculptures!

The art in this class room was so impressive. There were so many different styles and colors used in these works of art. It was incredible walking around the room and taking these pictures.

The APCSP and APCSA classrooms were very packed and full of students attempting to finish their assignments. However, there were also many other groups already done with theirs. I saw many different projects including binary gate project, GeoGuesser, and a Taylor Swift themed project. These were all very impressive and extremely hard to create.
