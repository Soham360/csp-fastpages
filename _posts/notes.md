BACKEND

Challenges: sending file from frontend to backend database, who gets admin access
frontend is basic input fields, once submitted, gets added to backend database
very hard to search through asb website for clubs
wants to make a search bar to allow people to search for keywords. Ex: search "environment" to see environment related clubs
database has many to one relationship
many reviews can be related with one club
if a club signs into their account, they can edit their profile

They have a spreadsheet to keep track of progress and stay on track
group has their scrumboard

chase innovation not 
quality over quantity
creativity over criteria
priortize continous integration
