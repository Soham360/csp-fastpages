Randomize until it is sorted. Find lowest/highest term and compare with other terms to get correct order. | . Explore . Get into groups of 3 . We will be focusing on 4 algorithms today. . We will look at the first one together, Bubble Sort . . What is happening with this sort? . It compares consecutive elements and sorts in a linear fashion. | . In your groups you will each choose to be an expert on a sorting algorithm. Merge, Selection, and Insertion.

If one is less than the other, I would put the lesser number a the front. Then i would move on to the second and third digits. I would continue this process multiple times until I know that the entire list is ordered correctly. | . | Selection Sort I would start with the first number and swap that with the least number. Then I would find the second number and swap that with the second least number. I would continue this until I was complete. | . | . [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51] . How would you sort this list with... . Merge Sort I would split the entire list into groups of two numbers. Then I would sort each group of two. Then I would merge each group of two with another group of two. Then I would sort that group of four. I would continue this until my entire list was sorted. | . | Insertion Sort I would sort the entire list until the lowest number is the first.

[0, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10] Insertion Sort because it goes through each pair and compares them and swaps them. It would have to swap until the 3rd pair and after this swap, the list would be sorted properly. | . | [Elephant, Banana, Cat, Dog, Apple] Selection Sort because it swaps the first item in the list with the lowest item. This means that Elephant would be swapped with Apple and after this change, the list would be sorted correctly. | . | [29, 13, 83, 47, 32, 78, 100, 60, 65, 15, 24, 9, 40, 68, 53, 8, 90, 58, 39, 32, 34, 91, 74, 94, 49, 87, 34, 87, 23, 17, 27, 2, 38, 58, 84, 15, 9, 46, 74, 40, 44, 8, 55, 28, 81, 92, 81, 88, 53, 38, 19, 21, 9, 54, 21, 67, 3, 41, 3, 74, 13, 71, 70, 45, 5, 36, 80, 64, 97, 86, 73, 74, 94, 79, 49, 32, 20, 68, 64, 69, 1, 77, 31, 56, 100, 80, 48, 75, 85, 93, 67, 57, 26, 56, 43, 53, 59, 28, 67, 50] Merge Sort because you can easily split the list into pairs of numbers and the sorting of each pair runs in parallel which would reduce the time required to sort this list. | . | . | . HACKS . Provided below is a Bubble Sort Algorithm sorting a list of dictionaries based off of selected key. . Now it&#39;s time to do some coding... . | Run code and then research and answer these questions... . Is a list and/or dictionary in python considered a primitive or collection type? Why? A list and a dictionary are considered collection types rather than primitive types. They are implemented using more complex data structures and algorithms than the primitive types. For example, a list in Python is typically implemented as a dynamic array, while a dictionary is usually implemented using a hash table. These data structures and algorithms are more complex than those used to implement primitive types, which is why they are considered collection types. | . | Is the list passed into bubble sort &quot;pass-by-value&quot; or &quot;pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output. The list passed into bubble sort is passed by reference, not by value. When a variable is passed as an argument to a function, a reference to the object is passed, not a copy of the object itself. | . | . | . Implement new cell(s) and/or organize cells to do the following. Create your own list | Use your expertise sorting algorithm (selection, insertion, merge). Note, I got my bubble sort from Geek for Geeks and made modifications.

Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers.

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. .

For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the following statements best explained the relationship between the Internet and the World Wide Web. I answered Option C because the World Wide Web has the word world in it so I thought the correct answer would be the one talking about the global network. I realize this is wrong because the Internet is a network of interconnected networks, but the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet. The correct answer is Option D because the Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet. . For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the following statements about the Internet was true. I answered Option D because I thought the Internet used a centralized system to determine how packets are routed. I realize this is wrong because routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance, nor is it controlled from a central location. The correct answer is Option B because the Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network. . For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the following pairs of spreadsheets can be combined and analyzed to determine the desired information. This question was very confusing for me and I ended up guessing Option C because it talked about high GPAs and students who play at least one sport. I realize this is wrong because the desired information cannot be determined with these two spreadsheets because students with grade point averages of 3.5 or less cannot be identified. The correction answer is Option A because The desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I. . MCQ7 Reflection . I’m really happy about my quiz result - got 67 out of 70! I did a lot better than my previous attempt at a multiple-choice questionnaire. This time, there were more questions, but I only got three wrong. Last time, I had messed up five answers. I found this quiz pretty easy and I think my preparations paid off. I’m proud of myself and hope to do just as well in the next one. .",

Two Main Machines . Which is better, MacOS or Windows? In, my opinion, Windows is better out of the two options given. However, Linux is better than both. | . | Give some differences between MacOS and Windows in terms of the development we use in APCSP: For MacOS, you have an ubuntu/Linux terminal preinstalled while for Windows, you have to install WSL. | . | If you are on Windows, you want to skip the MacOS Setup instructions. | . Our Tools: . What is the first tool you remember installing? The first tool I remember installing was WSL in Windows Powershell. | . | Why was installations so hard the first time? I&#39;ve never worked with Ubuntu/Linux before so it was very difficult for me to figure out what to do. | . | Without looking back at previous notes, name three tools you remember installing. This can be kernels, extensions, any installation for APCSP, and also write why it is needed. I remember installing, Bash, Anaconda, and VSCode. Bash was needed because it allowed me to run commands and scripts on my computer by typing them in the terminal. Anaconda was needed to easily install, update, and manage packages and dependencies for Python. VSCode is the most used out of the 3 and we use it everyday for working on code or just taking notes. | . | . Actual Installations: . Tool setup is a week 0 thing. You should already have the knowledge to set up your machine. There is also a high chance you had to remove your environments and set up your machine again due to errors. If, for some reason, these don&#39;t apply to you, go here to set up your machine, here to check everything working with Bash, and here for Docker setup, which are the main tools on our machine needed to develop in APCSP. . MacOS Conda Scripts . After installing Homebrew, VSCode, and Python2, you&#39;ll need to run these Homebrew commands: . brew list # list packages brew update # update package list brew upgrade # upgrade packages brew install git # install latest git brew install python # install python3 for development python --version # version of python3 installed brew install java # openjdk install . Windows Conda Scripts . To get set up, run these commands: . wsl --install wsl --list wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 # restart machine wsl cd ~ mkdir vscode ls cd ~/vscode # changes the directory to path for vscode files git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP.git # clone repo cd APCSP # changes the directory to path for APCSP repos assets code . # opens APCSP in VSCode cd .. # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory git config --global user.email mygmail@gmail.com # tell git your email git config --global user.name mygithub # tell git your github id shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.email your@email.here shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.name yourusernamehere # restart machine PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command cd /tmp wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # Answer yes to all the prompts ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # run apt package commands now sudo apt list # list packages sudo apt update # update package list sudo apt upgrade # upgrade packages sudo apt install python2 # install python2 for package dependencies sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # install python3 and pip3 for development python --version # version of python3 should be shown sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre # java install java --version # java runtime version javac --version # java compiler version sudo apt install unzip # unzip utility . Setting Up Kernels . Now that you have everything installed on MacOS/Windows, we need to get kernels installed so that we can develop inside Fastpages notebooks. To do that, run these commands on both MacOS and Windows: . (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels Available kernels: python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel Collecting bash_kernel Downloading bash_kernel-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (15 kB) Requirement already satisfied: pexpect&gt;=4.0 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from bash_kernel) (4.8.0) Requirement already satisfied: ptyprocess&gt;=0.5 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pexpect&gt;=4.0-&gt;bash_kernel) (0.7.0) Installing collected packages: bash-kernel Successfully installed bash-kernel-0.7.2 (base) id:~$ python -m bash_kernel.install # install kernel Installing IPython kernel spec (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ conda install nodejs # node is framework for JavaScript kernel (base) id:~$ npm -version # node package manager comes with nodejs (base) id:~$ npm install -g ijavascript # get the kernel (base) id:~$ ijsinstall # install javascript kernel (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash javascript /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/javascript python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 . By now, you should already know how to clone Git repositories into your VSCode directory. Once you do that, you&#39;re all set for developing with GitHub Pages and Fastpages! . Before We Set Up Pages, A Guide to Git . As we&#39;ve discussed, Git is different from GitHub. Because GitHub is merely the place where we store Git repos, we use Git&#39;s commands to help us get, open, and configure these repositories. Here are some of the Git commands you should be using a lot (In the comments, tell what each Git command does): . git clone {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? This command clones the repo and copies the github repository into your VSCode editor. git checkout [branch] # what does it do? This command switches your current working branch to the specified branch in your local repository. git fork {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? This command creates a copy of a repository on your GitHub account, which allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository. git commit -m {&quot;commit-msg&quot;} # what does it do? This command saves changes to your local repository and creates a new commit with a message describing the changes made. git pull # what does it do? This command fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them with your local repository. git push # what does it do? This command sends committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository. # After this line, name other commands that you can use and what they do. This should be easy, as you&#39;ve already answered the question git init # This command displays the commit history of a Git repository, showing all the commits made, their metadata (author, date, commit message), and a unique identifier for each commit. . Setting Up GitHub Pages . Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don&#39;t need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the Leuck Reunion repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can git clone our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head here to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, here to install Ruby next, and here to finalize the process by installing Bundler. . Setting Up FastPages . In Setting Up Github Pages, we talked about how it is easier to use a template to create portfolio content. It is also easier to use a template when creating the portfolio itself. To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won&#39;t be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow this video to get started developing with Fastpages. . Hacks . Show how you incorporate three tools that we have installed into your project. 0.1 points for each feature. (0.3). This can include code, but definitely blog about it.

            "content": "Introduction . Frontend and backend are two essential components of a web application. The frontend is the part of the application that interacts with the user, whereas the backend is the part that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes. . The frontend, also known as the client-side, typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs in the user&#39;s web browser. The frontend handles the user interface, page layout, and overall look of the application. It also handles user interactions, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. . On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, typically consists of a server, a database, and, in our case, APIs. The backend handles the processing and storage of data, manages user authentication and authorization, and handles business logic and rules. The backend also communicates with the frontend, providing the necessary data to render the user interface and processing user inputs. . Backend . In our class we mainly use Python and SQL/JSON to create APIs and databases. Here is a simple example of creating a SQL database and using CRUD as well. . What is CRUD . C: The &#39;C&#39; stands for create, meaning to create a new entry in a database. In this case, creating a new entry about a certain movie or TV show. . | R: Read, or to retrieve data from the database. In this case it is selecting the movie/TV shwo that you choose to display. . | U: Update, or changing an existing entry in the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and changing the values to match what you want. . | D: Delete, or removing data from the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and removing the entry from the database. . | . Films API . This API is intended to be used as a list of movies and TV shows that a person has watched. It includes attributes for the Film name(key), the year released, the language, the number of episodes, A list of the number of episodes(using pickletype), and a youtube url for the trailer. The CRUD works as follows: Create: Enter the above mentioned attributes Read: Returns all of the films and their attributes Update: Takes in new episodes watched, and a list of their names, and adds them to their respective attibutes Delete: Option for deleting every film, also takes in a name to delete that film if it exists . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;films.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, year INTEGER, epcount INTEGER, language TEXT, trailer TEXT, eplist TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database and close the connection conn.commit() conn.close() . import sqlite3 def create(): # Ask the user for movie details title = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO movies (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{title} has been added to the list of movies.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record:&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() .

            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Property decorators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controlled way. . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. . A getter allows us to access an attribute while a setter allows us to set or change the value of an attribute. . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functionality, this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects | Property decorators (getter and setter) | Class methods and static methods | Inheritance and method overriding | Working with multiple objects and class attributes | . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . SQL is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . CRUD is a set of basic commands that are used in database management. These commands are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. | Create command is used to create the SQL table for the database, as well as to insert new records and data into the database. | Read command is used to retrieve data from the database and display it. It is possible to retrieve only certain records or specific attributes of the records. | Update command is used to modify existing data in the database. It allows updating specific attributes of the records without changing the entire record. | Delete command is used to remove data from the database based on a specific attribute. This can help to manage the size of the database by removing outdated or irrelevant data. | . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Please enter c, r, u, or d tester has been added to the list of coding professors. . This block of code is a menu function that helps with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . soham has been added to the list of coding professors. . The menu function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: soham Field of expertise: gaming Rating: 10.0 Reviews: amazing . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite3 library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . Enter the new information for the professor: soham&#39;s record has been updated. . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute SQL commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an UPDATE statement with the new information to update the record in the database. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . This code is a Python function for deleting a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors. If the professor is not found in the database, the function prints a message indicating that the professor is not in the list. . To accomplish these tasks, the function first establishes a connection to the SQLite database using the sqlite3.connect() method. It then creates a cursor object that is used to execute SQL commands. The function prompts the user to enter the name of the professor they want to delete and then uses a SQL query to search the database for the professor with that name. The cursor object&#39;s execute() method is called with the SQL query and a tuple containing the name of the professor as its argument. The fetchone() method is then called on the cursor object to retrieve the record that matches the query. If the professor is found, the function prompts the user to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the cursor object&#39;s execute() method is called with another SQL query to delete the record from the database. The commit() method is called on the connection object to save the changes to the database. Finally, the function closes the cursor and connection to the database using the close() method on each object. . Our Project ... in the works . SAM Messaging System .

            "content": "Review Topics . All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics. . Lists . What are Lists? . Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable | Unlike dictionaries, lists&#39; keys are all integers that describe the order of the list | . | Some examples of lists: . Playlist of songs | names of students in a class | contacts on your phone | . | Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1. . AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc. | Python: 0,1,2,3 etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? Lists store data in them and are useful for storage. Collegeboard likes to use the word &quot;abstraction&quot; to describe the function of lists, as complex data structures are simplified. | . | . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . The output of the cell below is 10. | The mathematical expression I see being used is + which adds two inputs. I also see // which means floor division. If the output of (grade 1 + grade)/2 is a decimal, then it rounds down. | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . The original value of num1 was 2. The value was then changed to num2^num3 which is 4^6. This is 4096 and thats why 4096 was outputted when you run the program. | The original value of num2 was 4. The value was then changed to (num1 + num3)//9. The // symbol means floor division which means it adds num1 and num3 and then divides the sum by 9. If the answer includes a decimal, then it would round down. num1 + num3 is 4097 and when you divide that by 9 and round down, you get 455 and thats why 455 was outputted when you run the program. | The original value of num3 was 6. The value was then changed to num1%5 which is 4096%5. The % symbol represents the mod function which divides num 1 by 5 and then outputs the remainder. In this case, 4096%5 is 1 and thats why 1 was outputted when you run the program. | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of making decisions in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is true or false | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . x is positive . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is even divisible by 2 x is divisible by 3 . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level of indentation in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested within the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . Searching algorithm | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and compares the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: .

Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a et of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform tasks or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) | O(N*N) | . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . The time complexity will be O(N*N) because there is a nested for loop - or two for loops consecutively - which causes the time complexity of N to be squared. . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) | . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . n(n+1) n(n+1) because there are two for loops, and therefore n is iterated through twice. There is also the +1 becaue each time, a value is added by 1. . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of the input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have access to the index and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: When running a for loop to a dictionary, the loop iterates through the keys and values. Similarly, this format iterates through the index and the values, which is like the keys and values of dictionaries. . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(5) . 5 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 12 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . The randint function can be used to randomly generate an index from the deck. | . import random #find another random function that could pull a random card from a deck of UNSORTED cards . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value The simulation uses a random value to simulate the dice roll. | . | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) The simulation uses a list to represent the game board. | . | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) The simulation uses iteration to determine the player&#39;s position on the board. | . | Selection (use of conditionals) The simulation uses conditionals to determine the player&#39;s position on the board. | . | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 (or more with extra credit) out of the 3 possible points. . # (Concert attendance? Wind speeds? Interactions between subjects in large environments?) # Think about the sort of things that could be saved in lists, dictionaries, etc. # (Even better if you can take advantage of the specific features of multiple types of data sets!) # What kind of iteration happens in the real world? # What occurs repeatedly, even over a long period of time? # You could model the results of a disease spreading through a population without it taking IRL years. import random # Set up the game board board = [&quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Square 1&quot;, &quot;Square 2&quot;, &quot;Square 3&quot;, &quot;Square 4&quot;, &quot;Square 5&quot;, &quot;Finish&quot;] num_squares = len(board) player_pos = 0 # Roll the dice and move the player while player_pos &lt; num_squares - 1: roll = random.randint(1, 6) print(&quot;You rolled a&quot;, roll) player_pos += roll if player_pos &gt;= num_squares: player_pos = num_squares - 1 print(&quot;You are now on&quot;, board[player_pos]) print(&quot;Congratulations, you reached the finish!&quot;) . You rolled a 4 You are now on Square 4 You rolled a 3 You are now on Finish Congratulations, you reached the finish! . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter: a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api retrieves the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . Created user with username &#34;Mr. Cards&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Kard Kowntre&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Un Bea Table&#34;. . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . # If you&#39;ve already run the db.init_app(app) function while in this notebook, # don&#39;t do it again until you&#39;ve closed it! &quot;&quot;&quot; database dependencies to support sqliteDB examples &quot;&quot;&quot; from random import randrange from datetime import date import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash &#39;&#39;&#39; Tutorial: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials, try to get into Python shell and follow along &#39;&#39;&#39; # Define the Review class to manage actions in the &#39;reviews&#39; table # -- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the key concept of SQLAlchemy # -- a.) db.Model is like an inner layer of the onion in ORM # -- b.)

            "title": "SASS",
            "content": "Why SASS? . SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS, which means that Sass will translate the Sass code you wrote into CSS, which is what your web browser can read. . SASS vs SCSS . As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead. . We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used. . Getting started . A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages. . The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this one. . Within the repository, head over to assets/css/, and open style.scss. . This is where you can create your SASS code. . To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to _site/assets/css/style.css . Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears. . The first few hundred lines are used to style Github&#39;s theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS. . Nesting . CSS selectors can share the same element. | SASS provides a feature called nesting to write styling code in an HTML hierarchy. | SASS nesting makes code cleaner and more readable. | SASS nesting reduces repetition in code. | . Mini-hack . Write out the SASS equivalent for the following CSS code: . .a { .b { color: green; } .c { color: blue; } } . Extend/Inheritance . What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences? . Buttons have common properties such as clickability, shape, size, border, gradient, and font. | Each design category of buttons has distinct options. | . Notes . SASS allows for code reuse using @extend. | Buttons on the homepage have similarities and differences in their styling. | In CSS, specifying properties for each button selector would be necessary. | SASS can create a placeholder class using %class-name. | Code from the placeholder class can be called with @extend %class-name. | . Mixin . The article discusses using mixins in SASS for creating reusable code templates. | Mixins are similar to extends, but they can take parameters to create dynamic styling. | In the example of button styling, a @mixin at rule is created with two colors as parameters. | The mixin can be called using @include and passing in the desired colors. | Mixins can also contain styling rules that do not take in variables. | . Mini-hack . Write out a mixin in SASS that takes in a color and a font size as the parameter. Within the mixin, set the background color and font color to the color parameter, and set the font size to the font size parameter. Then create a selector that calls the mixin, and pass in a color and font size of your choice as the arguments. . @mixin myMixin($color, $fontSize) { background-color: $color; color: $color; font-size: $fontSize; } .my-selector { @include myMixin(#FF5733, 16px); } . Function . A toggle button can be created to change the SASS of a website, in the example below, it changes the theme. | SASS functions have a specific syntax: @function name(parameters) { //code @return value; }. | A function can be created to invert RGB colors, subtracting each RGB value from 255. | The invert function is called by specifying its name with parentheses and arguments inside them. | . Click the button below to toggle between light and dark mode: . Click me Import . It is important to manage cluttered SASS files. | Splitting the code into multiple files and then importing them into one file is very useful. | To create a separate file, a directory called _sass is to be created. | Recommended to create another SASS file for the specific code to be separated. | Import statement &quot;@import &#39;file-name&#39;&quot; can be used to import the separated file into the main SASS file. | . SASS Hacks . Take notes and complete the mini-hacks. (0.9) . | Complete the quiz questions and provide your answers in this notebook. (0.9) . b. A scripting language that has many styling operations | a. They are very similar in their function, but their syntax is slightly different | a. SASS has more functions than CSS | b. Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. | d. compute | b. extend | b. Directive | | Use SASS to create something that uses either extend or mixin. (0.9) . | @mixin button-style { display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 16px; color: #fff; background-color: #007bff; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; &amp;:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } } .button { @include button-style; } .button-large { @include button-style; font-size: 20px; padding: 15px 30px; } . Extra credit: Research other SASS features and blog about what you learned or add to your SASS project with any extra features not covered in this lesson. More points will be given if both are done. | Variables One of the most useful features of SASS is the ability to define variables. Variables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your stylesheet, which can save you a lot of time and make your code more consistent. | . | Control Directives SASS also offers control directives that allow you to write conditional statements and loops within your stylesheets. Control directives can be useful when you need to apply different styles based on specific conditions or when you need to generate styles dynamically. | . | .",

JavaScript in HTML- Questions . Where do you store the JavaScript Code? JavaScript code can be stored in a separate .js file or directly in the HTML file using a &lt;script&gt; tag. | . | How do you import a JS file into HTML? To import a JS file into an HTML file, you can use the &lt;script&gt; tag with the src attribute set to the URL of the JS file. For example, &lt;script src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; will import the script.js file. | . | What is onClick? onClick is an event handler attribute that can be added to an HTML element to specify a JavaScript function to be executed when the element is clicked. For example, &lt;button onClick=&quot;myFunction()&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; will call the myFunction() function when the button is clicked. | . | What tag do you use to write JavaScript code? The &lt;script&gt; tag is used to write JavaScript code in an HTML file. For example, &lt;script&gt;console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)&lt;/script&gt; will output &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console. | . | Hacks .

I know binary uses 1s and 0s | I know binary can be used to represent any number | I know binary can be used to represent any character | I know binary is base 2 because it only uses 2 number | I know all computers run on binary | . Binary is can be applied in many ways to store, access, and manipulate information. Think of three applications that rely on binary. . VsCode | Chrome | Fortnite | . Why is binary such an effective system for storing information? Why don&#39;t computers use the decimal system instead? . An electrical signal can be represented as a 1 and no electrical signal can be represented as a 0. Binary also reduces the time complexity because it is only 2 actions, 1s and 0s. | . Bitwise Opperations . Fill in the blank spots below during the lecture . Operator Name Action . &amp; | AND | Accepts 2 inputs. Returns true if both inputs are true. Otherwise returns false. | . PIPE | OR | Accepts 2 inputs. Returns one of them. | . ^ | XOR | Accepts 2 inputs. Returns the opposite of one of them. | . ~ | NOT | Accepts 1 input. Returns the opposite of that input. | . &lt;&lt; | Left Shift | Moves all the bits to the left by a specified number of positions | . &gt;&gt; | Right Shift | Moves all the bits to the right by a specified number of positions | . &gt;&gt;&gt; | Zero-fill Right Shift | Moves all the bits to the right by a specified number of positions, filling in the new bits with zeros. | . In this program, the operators &amp; (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) are used to perform the binary operations on the input numbers. The results are stored in separate variables as decimal numbers. Then, the bin() function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is unpacked into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary. . def binary_operations(num1, num2): # Perform the binary operations and_result_decimal = num1 &amp; num2 or_result_decimal = num1 | num2 xor_result_decimal = num1 ^ num2 not_result_decimal = ~num1 # Convert results to binary and_result_binary = bin(and_result_decimal)[2:] or_result_binary = bin(or_result_decimal)[2:] xor_result_binary = bin(xor_result_decimal)[2:] not_result_binary = bin(not_result_decimal)[2:] # Return the results as a tuple of tuples return ((and_result_decimal, and_result_binary), (or_result_decimal, or_result_binary), (xor_result_decimal, xor_result_binary), (not_result_decimal, not_result_binary)) # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) # Call the binary_operations function and print the results and_result, or_result, xor_result, not_result = binary_operations(num1, num2) print(num1, num2) print(&quot;AND result: decimal =&quot;, and_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, and_result[1]) print(&quot;OR result: decimal =&quot;, or_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, or_result[1]) print(&quot;XOR result: decimal =&quot;, xor_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, xor_result[1]) print(&quot;NOT result: decimal =&quot;, not_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, not_result[1]) . 2 58 AND result: decimal = 2 , binary = 10 OR result: decimal = 58 , binary = 111010 XOR result: decimal = 56 , binary = 111000 NOT result: decimal = -3 , binary = b11 . Bitwise operations are used in a variety of applications, particularly in low-level programming and computer science. Some common used of bitwise operations include:- Flag Management: Flags are used to keep track of the state of a system or a program. Bitwise operations can be used to set, clear, and toggle flags.- Bit Manipulation: Bitwise operations can be used to manipulate individual bits in a binary number. This is often used to extract specific bits from a number, set specific bits to a particular value, or flip the value of specific bits. . Masking: Masking is used to extract a subset of bits from a binary number. Bitwise operations are commonly used for masking, particularly in low-level programming. | Encryption: Bitwise operations can be used in cryptographic applications to scramble and unscramble data. One common application of bitwise operations in encryption is the XOR operation. | Graphics: Bitwise operations can be used in computer graphics to manipulate individual pixels on a screen. This can be used to draw shapes, change colors, and create special effects. | Networking: Bitwise operations are used extensively in networking applications, particularly in the handling of IP addresses and port numbers. | . Binary to String Conversion . This program defines a string_to_binary function that takes a string as input and returns the binary representation of the string. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, the ord function is used to get its ASCII code, which is then converted to binary using the format function with the &#39;08b&#39; format specifier to ensure that each binary number is 8 digits long. The resulting binary numbers are concatenated to form the final binary string. . # Function to convert a string to binary def string_to_binary(string): binary = &#39;&#39; for char in string: binary += format(ord(char), &#39;08b&#39;) # Convert the character to binary and append to the binary string return binary # Example usage word = input(&quot;Enter a word to convert to binary: &quot;) binary_word = string_to_binary(word) print(f&quot;The binary representation of &#39;{word}&#39; is {binary_word}&quot;) . The binary representation of &#39;soham&#39; is 0111001101101111011010000110000101101101 . Many programs use binary conversion, particularly those related to computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics. Programs that rely on binary conversion include:&gt; - Networking: Programs that deal with network addresses, such as IP addresses and subnet masks, use binary conversion to represent and manipulate the addresses.&gt; - Cryptography:Programs that deal with encryption and decryption use binary conversion to encode and decode data.&gt; - Computer Hardware:Programs that interface with computer hardware, such as drivers and firmware, often use binary conversion to communicate with the hardware at the binary level.&gt; - Mathematical Applications:Programs that deal with complex calculations and mathematical analysis, such as statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms, may use binary conversion to represent large numbers or complex data sets.&gt; - Finance:Programs that deal with financial calculations and accounting may use binary conversion to represent fractional amounts or complex financial data. . Binary Search . An algorithm made to find an item from a list of items | Works by dividing the list repeatedly to narrow down which half (the low or high half) that contains the item | Lists of integers are often used with binary search | Binary search makes searching more efficient, as it ensures the program won&#39;t have to search through an entire list of items one by one | List must be sorted | . What are some situations in which binary search could be used? . Number guessing game | Find an element in a sorted array | debugging a somewhat linear piece of code. if the code has many steps mostly executed in a sequence and there&#39;s a bug, you can isolate the bug by finding the earliest step where the code produces results which are different from the expected ones. | . Real Example of Binary Search . Binary search operates a lot like a &quot;guess the number&quot; game. Try the game and explain how the two are similar. . Guess a number. The program tells you if the number they have selected is higher or lower than your guess. You can then get the | . import random hid = random.randint(0,100) gues = 0 def game(): global gues gues += 1 num = int(input(&#39;Pick a number&#39;)) if num &lt; hid: print(&#39;higher&#39;) game() if num &gt; hid: print(&#39;lower&#39;) game() if num == hid: print(hid) print(&#39;You Win !!!&#39;) print(&#39;guesses: &#39;, gues) game() . lower higher higher 43 You Win !!! guesses: 4 .

(0.9) . | As your tangible, create a program that allows a user to input two numbers and an operation, converts the numbers to binary and performs the given operation, and returns the value in decimal values. (0.9) . | . Applying Binary Math - Calculator Hack . Calculators use binary math to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In a calculator, the binary digits are represented by electronic switches that can be either on or off, corresponding to 1 or 0 respectively. These switches are arranged in groups of eight to form bytes, which are used to represent larger numbers. When a user enters a number into a calculator, the number is converted into binary form and stored in the calculator&#39;s memory.To perform an arithmetic operation, the calculator retrieves the numbers from its memory and performs the operation using binary math. . For example, to add the binary numbers 1010 and 1101, the calculator would perform the following steps:&gt; 1. Add the rightmost digits, 0 and 1, which gives a sum of 1.&gt; 2. Move to the next digit to the left and add the digits along with any carry from the previous step. In this case, we have 1 + 0 + 1, which gives a sum of 10. The carry of 1 is then carried over to the next digit. . Repeat step 2 for the remaining digits until all digits have been added. | The result of the addition in this example is the binary number 10111, which is equivalent to the decimal number 23. | Similarly, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using binary math. The algorithms for these operations are based on the same principles as those used in decimal arithmetic, but with binary digits and powers of 2 instead of decimal digits and powers of 10. . def dec_to_bin(x): nums = [] while x &gt; 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = x // 2 nums.reverse() binary = &quot;&quot;.join(str(i) for i in nums) return binary def binary_math(bin1, bin2, operator): if operator == &quot;+&quot;: len_diff = len(bin1) - len(bin2) if len_diff &gt; 0: bin2 = &quot;0&quot; * len_diff + bin2 else: bin1 = &quot;0&quot; * abs(len_diff) + bin1 result = &quot;&quot; carry = 0 for i in range(len(bin1) - 1, -1, -1): bit_sum = int(bin1[i]) + int(bin2[i]) + carry if bit_sum == 2: result = &quot;0&quot; + result carry = 1 elif bit_sum == 3: result = &quot;1&quot; + result carry = 1 else: result = str(bit_sum) + result carry = 0 if carry: result = &quot;1&quot; + result return result elif operator == &quot;-&quot;: len_diff = len(bin1) - len(bin2) if len_diff &gt; 0: bin2 = &quot;0&quot; * len_diff + bin2 else: bin1 = &quot;0&quot; * abs(len_diff) + bin1 result = &quot;&quot; borrow = 0 for i in range(len(bin1) - 1, -1, -1): diff = int(bin1[i]) - int(bin2[i]) - borrow if diff &lt; 0: result = &quot;1&quot; + result borrow = 1 else: result = str(diff) + result borrow = 0 return result elif operator == &quot;*&quot;: product = 0 for i, bit1 in enumerate(reversed(bin1)): for j, bit2 in enumerate(reversed(bin2)): if bit1 == &#39;1&#39; and bit2 == &#39;1&#39;: product += 2 ** (i + j) return bin(product)[2:] elif operator == &quot;/&quot;: len_diff = len(bin1) - len(bin2) if len_diff &lt; 0: return &quot;Invalid operation.&quot; bin2 = &quot;0&quot; * len_diff + bin2 quotient = &quot;&quot; remainder = bin1 while len(remainder) &gt;= len(bin2): if remainder[0] == &quot;0&quot;: quotient += &quot;0&quot; remainder = remainder[1:] else: quotient += &quot;1&quot; remainder = binary_math(remainder, bin2, &quot;-&quot;) return quotient else: return &quot;Invalid operator.&quot; # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) operator = input(&quot;Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): &quot;) bin1 = dec_to_bin(num1) bin2 = dec_to_bin(num2) # Call the binary_math function and print the result result = binary_math(bin1, bin2, operator) print(bin1, operator, bin2) print(&quot;Result:&quot;, result) . 101 + 110010 Result: 110111 .",

I answered Option A because I saw that A and B were both true so the output for an OR gate would also be true. However I was wrong and if A was false and B was true, the OR gate would still output true. I didn’t read the other Options so I got this question wrong. The correct answer is Option C because when A is false, B is true, C is true, and D is true, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of true. Since both inputs to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of true. This is why the answer is Option C. . For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the algorithms run in reasonable time. I thought since n was a very large integer, the first two algorithms could not be the answer because they access each element in the list twice and n times, respectively. To me, this meant the answer had to be algorithm 3 or Option B. However, I was wrong because algorithm 1 accesses elements 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n2 elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. This is why the answer is Option D. . MCQ6 Reflection .

I answered Option A and Option C. Option A was correct but unfortunately, Option C was incorrect. I answered this because it was a difficult question. I knew it could not be Option B because replacing longer variable names with shorter variable names to reduce typing errors seemed like an edge-case issue. This meant the last answer must be Option C or Option D. I answered Option C because it seemed more broad and I thought it included Option D in it. This is why I answered this. I realize now that Option D is correct because creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program. .

            "content": "My Score . . MCQ4 Corrections . For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the following answers best describes how the file is sent to the user. I incorrectly answer Option B because I knew that the file is broken into packets for transmission but I thought some packets are lost in transmission and to make sure all packets arrive safely, the browser must keep requesting in order until all packets are received. I was wrong and the correction answer was Option A because the browser doesn’t need to request all of the packets in order and that they are reassembled after they arrive. . For this question, you were supposed to answer how two computer communicate if one is running a Web server and the other is running a Web browser. I wasn’t sure how to attempt this question so I thought that if one of the computers is running a Web browser and you can only search the web using text inputs, the computers could only communicate if the messages consist of text and other formats couldn’t be interpreted across the computers. This is why I chose Option C and I was wrong. The correct answer was Option D because all data on a computer is stored in binary. Individual computers can interpret different file formats if each computer contains the appropriate software. The structure and functionality of the Internet does not affect the ability of two computers to share files. . For this question, you were supposed to answer how a photographer could losslessly transform a digital image. I incorrectly guessed Option D because I thought if you copy and paste pixels, no pixel would be lost. However I was wrong because by copying pixels from one part of the image to another part of the image, the old RGB values of the pixels have been lost. The correct answer was Option C because if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. . For this question, you were supposed to answer which of the following statements is true about the use of a simulation for this project. I incorrectly answered Option B because I thought making a simulation would cost more money on top of the actual project. I was wrong and the correct answer was actually Option D. Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments. Discovering and correcting potential safety issues using a simulation before the train route is constructed is much safer and less expensive than discovering them after the train route has been constructed. . For this question, you were supposed to determine which of the following code segments gave the correct output. This question was extremely confusing to me and I incorrectly guess Option C. The correct answer was Option A because the code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. . MCQ4 Reflection . I got 45/50 on this quiz and my score is worse than usual. I’m feeling a bit disappointed but I’m determined to improve and score even better on the next quiz. There were a lot of new topic that I didn’t understand fully such as lossy vs lossless data compression and the communication between servers and computers. I will study these topics before the next quiz and I want to get at least a 47/50 next time. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;1&#39;]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # The output only contains unique characters. For example, if 1 appears in the set twice, it will only get printed once. Also if there is 1 and &quot;1&quot; in the set, both will get printed because the first 1 is a integer while the second &quot;1&quot; is a string. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # Dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys either. . {1, 2, 3, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;b&#39;} .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . I think a programmer should care about space and time complexity because it is better if an algorithm suns faster and uses less memory. If a program has a lot of Space Complexity, it uses more memory and if a program has a lot of Time Complexity, it takes more time.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think this is a space complexity problem. If the image has a a higher baseWidth, it takes more memory due to the larger size and takes more time to display. This is why images with a smaller baseWidth display faster than images with a larger baseWidth. The time depends on the space. So this is mainly a space complexity problem. | . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 2.2724533081054688 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.4413843154907227 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. The time elapsed for O(1) is always constant and resembles a y=1 graph. The time and space complexity is always the same. | The time elapsed for O(N) is linear and resembles a y=x graph. The time and space complexity increase at a constant rate. | The time elapsed for O(N^2) is parabolic but since time and space cannot be negative, it resembles a y=x^2 with a x&lt;=0 domain constraint. The time and space complexity increases exponentially. | The time elapsed for O(log(N)) is exponential and resembles a y=log(x) graph. The time and space increase extremely fast at first but then slow down a lot later. | The time elapsed for O(2^N) is exponential and resembles a y=2^x graph. The time and space complexity increases exponentially. | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Selection Sort - O(N^2) | Bubble Sort - O(N) | Insertion Sort - O(N) | Heap Sort - O(N*log(N)) | Quick Sort - O(N*log(N)) | Merge Sort - O(N*log(N)) | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? You need to optimize both space and time complexity when choosing an algorithm. If a program takes too much space, it will probably take a lot of time to run and give an output. However, if a programs takes too little space, it will probably run in an acceptable time but will not have enough data. Finding the perfect amount of both space and time complexity is very important for choosing an algorithm. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? Most of the time, a constant time algorithm is faster and more scalable. However sometimes, an exponential time algorithm must be used because a constant time algorithm is not available. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? The larger the data and the algorithm used affects the time and memory needed for a program to run. Binary search is faster than exponential algorithms because it cuts the list in half each time. Iterating through the list multiple times causes longer processing times. | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Practice Problems .

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? The &quot;ls&quot; command is used to display a list of all files in the current directory, while the &quot;cd&quot; command is used to navigate into directories. To read the contents of a file, the &quot;cat&quot; command can be used, and to edit a file, &quot;sudo nano&quot; can be used. | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? The &quot;dir&quot; command is used to view the list of files and folders contained within a directory. To open a file, you can simply type the name of the file and press the ENTER key. | . | What are some of the major differences? The biggest difference lies in the use of different commands to open and access files, such as &quot;ls&quot; vs &quot;dir&quot;. These commands are specific to different operating systems - &quot;ls&quot; is used in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS, while &quot;dir&quot; is used in Windows. Additionally, the commands for opening and accessing files also differ between operating systems. | . | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? Images are generally more accessible and easier to use compared to other file types. They can be easily viewed, shared, and manipulated using a variety of software tools. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? Metadata can have both beneficial and harmful effects, depending on how it is used. On the one hand, metadata can provide valuable information about a file, such as the date it was created, who created it, and its file size. This can be useful for organizing and searching for files, as well as for verifying the authenticity of a file. | However, metadata can also pose a privacy risk, as it can contain sensitive information that could be used to track or identify individuals. For example, photos taken with a smartphone often contain location data in their metadata, which could reveal where a person has been. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of metadata, and to use it responsibly. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython&#39;s inclusion of interactive shells allows for greater interaction between the notebook and the user, making it easier to work with tools such as Pandas and images. This enhanced interactivity provides a more user-friendly experience and enables users to quickly explore and manipulate data. Additionally, IPython provides a range of features that are not available in traditional Python shells, such as tab completion and command history. All of these benefits combine to make IPython a more powerful and efficient tool for data analysis and exploration. | . | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Soham Kamat&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;Smiley.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . - Binary uses the numbers `0` and `1`, Hexadecimal uses the numbers `0-9` and the lowercase letters `a-f`. Meanwhile, base64 uses the numbers `0-9`, the lowercase letters `a-z`, the uppercase letters `A-Z`, and the characters `+` and `/` . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. Soh = U29o | . | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? One time, during a very stormy weather, I was watching YouTube and the video I was watching started buffering. It paused and there was a loading animation. This was due to the large amount of data that was unable to be displayed due to the slow download speeds. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? A lot of times, the video I&#39;m watching doesn&#39;t load, and sometimes the game I&#39;m playing freezes me in place until I regain connection. | . | How do these effects apply to images? When there are large images or very graphic images, buffering tends to occur more. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? The code slightly seems like a series of steps. There are multiple functions being performed in order and there are many operations done within each function. | . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The algorithm first receives a scaled size of the image, and data is retrieved from the image. The amount of pixels retrieved is then averaged and appended to the data. The image data is then returned. | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The scale image scales the height and width of the image to a certain amount. Some images are scaled to a bigger size while others are shrunk. | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scale is a type of compression - lossless compression. Original data is not being permanently removed, and instead, the file size is reduced by removing metadata - therefore, lossless. | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

This program allows users to added reviews on recipes they found on our site. They can rate the recipe out of 10 and add a short comment summarizing how they felt after creating the recipe. They can also edit the review after it has been created and also delete the review. . 3.a.ii. . In the video, I showed the ability to search for a recipe and add a review for said recipe. I also shows the ability to edit an comment and also delete it. The program takes a rating out of 10, a short comment, and the user’s name. The program then uses a POST Request to add the input to a database. It then uses a GET Request to retrieve that data and formats it into a table. After the review has been posted, there is an edit button and a delete button. The edit button allows you to edit the comment using a PUT Request. The delete button allows you to delete the review using a DELETE Request. . 3.a.iii. . The inputs of the program are the rating, the comment, and the user’s name. The program detects these inputs and returns an output by adding the user’s information into the review table below the input area. The program also takes an input through the edit and delete buttons. When clicked, the edit button returns an output by enabling the ability to edit the comment. The delete button, when clicked, returns an output by deleting the review. . 3b. . 3.b.i. . . 3.b.ii. . . 3.b.iii. .

            "content": "My Score . . MCQ3 Corrections . For this question, you were supposed to determine if the programmer’s conclusion that their program works as intended was correct. I believed that it was correct but unfortunately, I was wrong. I thought Option A was correct because 0+1+4+5=10 and I thought the program was just adding all of the numbers in the list together. The program was actually setting the starting value to the first value in the list and then adding all of the numbers together. This means the first number was added twice and this is incorrect. This means the correct answer is Option C because if the test case was [9, 1, 4, 5], the program would display 28 but the correct sum would be 19. This is why the correct answer is Option C. . For this question, you were supposed to explain why a computer program got 0 when adding 5 and 3. I wasn’t sure how to attempt this question so I just guessed Option D. What happened was when you convert 3 to binary, you get 011 and when you convert 5 to binary, you get 101. When you add them, you get 8 which is expressed as 1000 in binary. However the program can only handle the last 3 bits, 000. 000 in binary is equal to 0 and this is how the error occurred. There were too many bits for the program to handle and there was an “overflow of integers”. This is why the answer is Option A. . For this question, you were supposed to select 2 answers. I correctly selected Option A but incorrectly selected Option C. I thought, because a simulation has the same environment every time it is run, it would also have the same output every time. This is incorrect. The correct answer was Option B because sometimes an experiment is impractical and cannot be repeated multiple times. In a case like this, it makes more sense to use a simulation. This is why the correct answer is Option B. . For this question, you were supposed to describe a limitation of using a simulation to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. When I read this question, I thought of the word “limitation” as a negative affect of using a simulation so I selected the answer that talked about a negative part of using a simulation. I selected Option A but that was wrong. The correct answer was Option B because if the simulation software omits details, it is a limitation because you don;t know those details. This is why the answer is Option B. . MCQ3 Reflection . I feel like I did really well and only got 4 wrong out of 50. This is a really good score for me but my score decreased by 1 because I got 47/50 on MCQ2 and now I got 46/50 on MCQ3. They only questions I messed up on were questions that were worded badly or confusing. I also got a question wrong because we hadn’t even learned the material yet. I’ll study this and try to improve next time. .",

Night at the Museum is typically held near the end of the trimester, and it serves as a platform for students in art and craft classes to display their final projects.

Computer Science students present their final projects in teams, while Drawing and Painting students showcase their best art pieces. Students in 3D Animation display their digital artwork, while Ceramics students exhibit their sculptures. I found this event to be particularly enjoyable because it allowed me to view the creative works of my friends in their respective classes, as well as showcase my own. The caliber of the projects was impressive, with many of them showcasing exceptional creativity. . . 3D Animation . Here are a few pictures of art work for 3D Animation.

It was incredible walking around the room and taking these pictures. . . AP Computer Science Principles . Here is a picture of me showing a visitor my recipe review feature. Theres also a couple pictures of another APCSP group’s project. The APCSP and APCSA classrooms were very packed and full of students attempting to finish their assignments. However, there were also many other groups already done with theirs. I saw many different projects including an arcade, an F1 race betting site, and a fitness tracker.

From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. . License Communities, License Types Guide . Adding and selecting a license GitHub instructions. An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license.

Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. . Open Source MIT License . This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. Typically, the author of software with MIT License want credit. Credit could be as simple as adding the authors name in comments. . Close source means the GitHub project could be private. . Open Source GPL License . The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . Open source means the GitHub project must be public. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts (public vs private). Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL or Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution, not deploy to public, etc. After distribution, the customer of the Patented (ie Qualcomm) product is required to put the public/private domain code back together again. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal. . In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is “no problem” with Open Source as our usage is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to! This was in the terms of the licenses they were using, GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establishing unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model using Android. . Creative Commons, Open Source are free terminologies! However, businesses will not last without income. And today, businesses won’t last without engineers pulling Open Source software. .

An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1.

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of “never”. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is “halts”. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of “never”. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. The halting problem, in which a computer tries to determine whether a given program will run forever or eventually stop, is an example of an undecidable problem. This is because it has been proven that no algorithm can accurately predict the behavior of all possible programs, and there are certain programs that cannot be predicted to either halt or run indefinitely. This means that in some cases, a computer may be unable to solve a problem because it is undecidable. | . | . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, studying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 1.0 seconds for an object that weighs 9999999 pounds to fall 4.9 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . 1.0999999999999999 5.928999999999999 . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomly generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | . (explain further) . import random x = 0 y = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): step = random.randrange(4) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 turn = turn + 1 if x == 0 and y == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Man Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;)&quot;) if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average, &quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . import random # Dictionary to simulate the vending machine&#39;s inventory vending_machine = { &quot;Coke&quot;: 3, &quot;Sprite&quot;: 5, &quot;Water&quot;: 10 } # Function to dispense a drink from the vending machine def dispense_drink(drink): if vending_machine.get(drink) != None: # Check if the drink is in the vending machine&#39;s inventory if vending_machine[drink] &gt; 0: # Check if the drink is in stock vending_machine[drink] -= 1 # Dispense the drink and decrement the stock return f&quot;Here is your {drink}&quot; else: return &quot;Sorry, that drink is currently out of stock.&quot; else: return &quot;Sorry, we don&#39;t carry that drink.&quot; # Simulate a customer purchasing a random drink drink = random.choice(list(vending_machine.keys())) # Choose a random drink from the vending machine&#39;s inventory result = dispense_drink(drink) print(result) . Here is your Coke . . Grand Theft Auto V uses simulations to model the behaviors and interactions of pedestrians, traffic, and other objects in the game world. The game&#39;s physics engine simulates the movement and collision of objects, and its weather system simulates the effects of weather on the game world. .",

Kathyleen Beveridge and Kris Porter are two computer scientists who used to work at Qualcomm with Mr. Mortensen. They talked about their experiences and the projects they’ve worked on. They gave some recommendations on how to be a better Computer Scientist. They ended the seminar with a few questions from the audience. . Takeaways . Today I learned that learning to code should not be your first priority. Your first priority is to be able to learn and grow from your mistakes. You have to be able to adapt and be flexible. Kathyleen Beveridge proved that you can adapt and be flexible when she transitioned from a job as a Computer Scientist to a job at a Biology based company. I think most of the lessons talked about during the lecture can be applied to many things in life. .",

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. . PROCEDURE Dice(n) sum ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL n = 0 sum ← sum + RANDOM(1, 6) n ← n - 1 RETURN sum . import random # Fill in the blank def Dice(n): sum = 0 while(n!=0): sum = sum + random.randint(1,6) n = n-1 return(sum) Dice(5) # Will output a range of __ to __ . 3 . Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them.

A ___ is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as ___ or ___, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. ___ specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the ___ execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was ___. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of ___. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and ___ the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a __ or ___, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . True . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: .

What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . (IMAGE HERE) . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . (IMAGE HERE) . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . (IMAGE HERE) . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 8 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 5 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: . list -&gt; . lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() for i in range(len(inp)): for j in range(len(words)): if inp[i] == words[j][0]: print(words[j]) . hotel echo lima lima oscar whiskey oscar romeo lima delta . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in range(len(keypad)): print(*keypad[i]) keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] print(keyboard[3][6], keyboard[2][0], keyboard[1][3], keyboard[3][2], keyboard[2][5]) print(keyboard[0][1], keyboard[0][5]) . M A R C H 1 5 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] print(&quot; &quot;, keyboard[0][1], &quot; &quot;, keyboard[0][5], &quot; &quot;) print(&quot; &quot;, keyboard[1][3], &quot; &quot;) print(keyboard[2][0], &quot; &quot;, keyboard[2][5], &quot; &quot;) print(&quot; &quot;, keyboard[3][2], &quot; &quot;, keyboard[3][6], &quot; &quot;) .

            "content": "Algorithm . An algorithm typically means &#39;code&#39; that solves a problem. Designing an algorithm often requires you to learn the Tech first and then consider how you design your code and algorithms. Code design can take many iterations. . Truth Tables . My topic for this blog is Truth Tables. The illustration that follows displays the results of logical operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT versus binary 1 and 0. The output produces a &#39;Truth Table&#39;. . Exploring Truth Tables operations . Exploration of this topic requires searching the language for logical operators, then figuring out how to display condition and test result. . Bitwise operations for Truth Tables typically represent 1 - True and 0 - False. | Logical expression in iteration and selection statements result in True or False | . My objective is Truth Tables. But in my exploration I did both Truth Table and Expression syntax . print(&quot;OR&quot;) print( &quot;1 | 0 = &quot;, 1 | 0) print( &quot;~(1 | 0) = &quot;, ~(1 | 0) % 2) # 1 is an integer, not a bit so remainder (modulo) does trick print(&quot;AND&quot;) print( &quot;1 &amp; 0 = &quot;, 1 &amp; 0) print( &quot;~(1 &amp; 0) = &quot;, ~(1 &amp; 0) % 2) # modulo again print(&quot;XOR&quot;) print( &quot;1 ^ 1 = &quot;, 1 ^ 1) print() # Boolean Tests print(&quot;Boolean OR&quot;) print( &quot;True or False = &quot;, True or False) print(&quot;Boolean AND&quot;) print( &quot;True and False = &quot;, True and False) print(&quot;Boolean XOR&quot;) print( &quot;True != True = &quot;, True != True) .

This algorithm focuses on small reusable procedures/functions (def) for bitwise tests. From the exploratory experience above it seems like a lot of typing would be necessary to represent possibilities. . import operator # functions for all comparisons, logical operations, mathematical operations and sequence operations # builds truth table def truth_options(): a_opts = [1, 0] b_opts = [1, 0] return [(a, b) for a in a_opts for b in b_opts] # double for permutes options # provides equivalent function lookup for bitwise using operator functions def bitwise_options(op): ops = {&#39;&amp;&#39;: operator.and_, &#39;|&#39;: operator.or_, &#39;^&#39;: operator.xor} return ops[op] # control/eval for bitwise operators, selection is based on number of operators def bitwise_eval(op, op2=&quot;&quot;): if op2 == &quot;&quot;: op_func = bitwise_options(op) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{a} {op} {b} is {op_func(a, b)}&quot;) else: op2_func = bitwise_options(op2) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{op}({a} {op2} {b}) is {(1, 0)[op2_func(a, b)]}&quot;) # opposite: index 0 returns 1, index 1 return 0 def method1(): bitwise_eval(&quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NAND&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NOR&quot;, &quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;^&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 1 *****&quot;) method1() . ***** Method 1 ***** Bitwise &amp; 1 &amp; 1 is 1 1 &amp; 0 is 0 0 &amp; 1 is 0 0 &amp; 0 is 0 Bitwise NAND NAND(1 &amp; 1) is 0 NAND(1 &amp; 0) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 1) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 0) is 1 Bitwise | 1 | 1 is 1 1 | 0 is 1 0 | 1 is 1 0 | 0 is 0 Bitwise NOR NOR(1 | 1) is 0 NOR(1 | 0) is 0 NOR(0 | 1) is 0 NOR(0 | 0) is 1 Bitwise ^ 1 ^ 1 is 0 1 ^ 0 is 1 0 ^ 1 is 1 0 ^ 0 is 0 . Truth Table - Algorithm 2 . This algorithm above seemed to me to lose clarity with all the functions. The second attempt focuses on truth tables as a linear sequence, with loops for required repetitions. This seemed more understandable to me than my 1st attempt. . def method2(): truth_table = [[1,1], [1,0], [0,1], [0,0]] for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;and {a} &amp; {b}: {a &amp; b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nand ~({a} &amp; {b}): {((a &amp; b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: ~ negates entire integer without modulo for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;or {a} | {b}: {a | b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nor ~({a} | {b}): {((a | b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: see above for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;xor {a} ^ {b}: {a ^ b}&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 2 *****&quot;) method2() . ***** Method 2 ***** and 1 &amp; 1: 1 and 1 &amp; 0: 0 and 0 &amp; 1: 0 and 0 &amp; 0: 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 1): 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 0): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 1): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 0): 1 or 1 | 1: 1 or 1 | 0: 1 or 0 | 1: 1 or 0 | 0: 0 nor ~(1 | 1): 0 nor ~(1 | 0): 0 nor ~(0 | 1): 0 nor ~(0 | 0): 1 xor 1 ^ 1: 0 xor 1 ^ 0: 1 xor 0 ^ 1: 1 xor 0 ^ 0: 0 . Linear Sequence of code . The order of executions is strictly from top to bottom. This is good for learning, but is typically a poor method for an Algorithm! This was my 1st exploration above. . Procedure (Function) . A Procedure is a set of code instructions that has been abstracted into logical parts. Each code abstraction is called &quot;Procedural Abstraction&quot;. . In Python, using procedures (def) means you are starting to write &quot;good&quot; code vs &quot;bad&quot; code, mostly in terms of reusability of logic. | A procedure needs to be activated or called, this is performed in the main selections above. | . Hacks . As we explore the algorithm Unit students will be designing lessons and homework. Each lesson will have Hacks. Here are some hacks that could go with the lesson above. The three weeks after Thanksgiving will be focused on this activity and build personal portfolio. . Try to build a Truth Table as shown above in Python, but switch to JavaScript... .

However, most of the problems were pseudocode where you are given a block of code and asked for the output or an error in the code. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Mostly they were easy for me because I have prior programming knowledge but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . . What I missed . I missed 4 questions. One of the questions I got wrong was due to a silly mistake. In that question, I had to add 8 with 4 and 4 and somehow got 12. I also missed couple questions because I just forgot some information on the internet and another simple problem. The last question I got wrong was due to me not realizing an integer could be a string. . The questions I missed were Question 17, Question , Question , and Question . . Question 17 . Q: Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet? . A: Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance. B: Open protocols ensure that all data transmission on the Internet is kept secure. C: Open protocols ensure that all Internet users are provided connections with equal bandwidth. (Selected, remembered something about equal/standard so I clicked this) D: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. . Question 23 . Q: The position of a runner in a race is a type of analog data. The runner’s position is tracked using sensors. Which of the following best describes how the position of the runner is represented digitally? . A: The position of the runner is determined by calculating the time difference between the start and the end of the race and making an estimation based on the runner’s average speed. (Selected, guessed this question) B: The position of the runner is measured and rounded to either 0 or 1 depending on whether the runner is closer to the starting line or closer to the finish line. C: The position of the runner is predicted using a model based on performance data captured from previous races. D: The position of the runner is sampled at regular intervals to approximate the real-word position, and a sequence of bits is used to represent each sample. . Question 39 . Q: The list wordList contains a list of 10 string values. Which of the following is a valid index for the list? . A: -1 B: “hello” (Selected, thought hello was the only string) C: 2.5 D: 4 . Question 42 . Q: Consider the following code segment. What is the value of sum after the code segment is executed? . A: 12 (Selected, messed up my math) B: 14 C: 16 D: 18 . . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully and rechecking my answers after I’m done. I also have to remember to study the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms. . . Results . Here is a screenshot of the results of my Trimester 1 Final on Collegeboard. .",

The classes showing off their work during this event include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, APCSP, APCSA, and more. In the Computer Science classes, teams present their final project, while in Drawing and Painting, students show off their best art piece. 3D Animation students also presented their digital artworks while Ceramics students presented their sculptures. I thought this event was really fun because I could see what my friends did in their classes while they could see what I did in mine. A lot of the projects were really creative and I was very impressed. . . AP Studio Art . Here are a few pictures of art work in Studio Art. I was really impressed by all of the art that the students created. I know I would never be able to create such amazing pieces. I was really blown away by the piece above. It was very large, about 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide and it was very detailed and realistic. . . Ceramics . Here is a picture of sculptures in Ceramics. Ceramics seems like a really easy art to do but I know it really isn’t. It incredible how they are able to use rough, gray or brown clay, and create such colorful, shiny, sculptures! . . Drawing and Painting . Here is a picture of art work in Drawing and Painting. The art in this class room was so impressive. There were so many different styles and colors used in these works of art. It was incredible walking around the room and taking these pictures. . . AP Computer Science Principles . Here is a picture of Orlando Carcamo with his project that can tell you the weather in San Diego. The APCSP and APCSA classrooms were very packed and full of students attempting to finish their assignments. However, there were also many other groups already done with theirs. I saw many different projects including chess, a weather app, and a fitness tracker. These were all very impressive and extremely hard to create. .",

            "content": "Planning Process . Here is the To Do List of all the Jobs given to each member of our team: . We ran into many issues while working together on this project. One of these issues was that we kept running into merge conflicts when making commits. This was because while we were working on it individually, when one person saved a file and another person already made a commit, the commit button for Person 1 would show up instead of the Pull button. To solve this problem, we decided to use a VSCode extension called LiveShare. LiveShare allows people to edit files like it is a shared Google Document and saves all of the changes to the host’s computer, reducing the chance of a merge conflict. Also, to undo merge conflicts, I did some research and found the command rm -rf .git/MERGE*. You run this in the terminal and then discard the changes. After this, the merge conflict is solved. . Progress . During the first week we got for this assignment, we created an API that displays the definition of a Computer Science related word. We accomplished this by making a dictionary that stores the vocab word as a key and the definition as a value. We also added 28 clickable buttons. These buttons consisted of one for every letter in the alphabet plus a period and a space. . This week we plan to make each letter tangible, create a place where the unknown word will be shown, and create an area for letters that are incorrect. Additionally, we need the program to look presentable for the user as well as to keep updating the API containing the vocabulary words. Finally, we need to switch between the images of the hangman when the guesses are incorrect. The hangman will gain body parts when the guess is incorrect but will not change if the guess is correct. . Commits . Here are the number of commits made by my group members: .",

Each packet also includes the source and the destination information | . | . How do we get computers to connect and communicate? . A computer system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data | . Packet Switching . Packet Switching: the message(file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device | . Path and Routing . Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender or receiver) is a sequence of directly connecting computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver | . Bandwidth . The bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network | Typically measured in bits per second | . 1) Path - a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver 2) Route - The process of finding a path from sender to receiver 3) Computer System - A group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose 4) Computer Device - A physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors 5) Bandwidth - The maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time 6) Computer Network - A group of interconnecting computing devices capable of sending or receiving data . Daily Video 2 . Recap . A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information | A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system | . Computer Protocol Models . OSI (Open Systems Interconnect): The layers you have to go through to communicate. 7 Groups of Protocols (1-Physical, 2-Data Link, 3-Network, 4-Transport, 5-Session, 6-Presentation, 7-Application) | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Establishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet | IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force): Manages the development of standards and technical discussions concerning the internet in an open and collaborative process | Network Access Layer This layer is focused on the hardware and protocols that carry 0’s and 1’s between two devices | Most common Network Access protocol is Ethernet, implemented in Network Interface Cards. A general function of the physical layer is to deliver packets from one NIC to another (“hop”) | Each NIC has a unique address associated with it called a Media Access Control (MAC) Address. It is used for local “hops” | . | Network Access/Internet Layer Data Transmission A packet contains data that is being transmitted as well as metadata containing informating used for routing information | . | Internet Layer The Internet was designed to be scalable-able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | . | Transport Layer Open standards and protocols enable different manufacturers and developers to build hardware and software that can communicate with hardware and software on the rest of the internet | . | Internet and Transport Layers Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what Reliability - Reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed Unreliability - send and forget | Purpose - Port number assigned to an application or service | . | Application Layer Web Servers | DNS- Domain Name Service Applications that translate a human readable URL to an IP address | . | World Wide Web (WWW) is not the Internet! | . | . | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open communication protocols | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet computing device | A protocol is a set of rules that specify the behavior of a system | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands | The Internet was designed to be scalable | . Personal Takeaways . After watching these two videos, I now find it pretty fascinating about how the Internet works, as it is much more complex than I thought it was. I was able to learn many new things about the Internet and get a better grasp of how it can be applied to many of the things that we do on the Internet in our daily lives. With this big idea, I had to rewatch certain segments of the video to truly understand what it was talking about. Overall, watching these videos helped me realize the complexity of how the Internet works, and I will definitely be taking what I learned here into more consideration in the many things that I do online. .

Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? Some errors that may occur during the development of the project could be syntax errors and incorrectly formatting code. These mistakes are very easy to fix but extremely hard to notice. They can cause a lot of problems and make a program not function as intended. Another error that may occur is writing a program in the incorrect language. I&#39;ve written so many programs incorrectly because I created it in the wrong language. This is another easy to fix but annoying issue that may come up. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? Some test cases that could be used as words that are used in multiple languages because they could be spelt the same way but have different meanings. Another test case that could be used is words that are very long and have a lot of characters. They could break the program simply by being too long for the program to understand. | . | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

            "content": "The Development Process (Video 1): . All programs originate from an idea. That idea is what gives the program a certain purpose. The best way developers turn their ideas into reality is by following specific steps and stick to it. However, these steps are more of a guideline. The development of a program is a lot more exploratory and steps that you follow are dependent on what happens during development. However some steps are essential and you must do them no matter what happens. . First, the developers must find the problem and think about it. This is where the developers understand the requirements, constraints, and users interest. They obtain this information by creating surveys, testing users, hosting interviews, or observing others. . | After reflecting, observing, and investigating, developers start planning how to build the program. This is when they start brainstorming ideas, planning out the code, and create a testing strategy on their work. . | Once the program has been made, the developers talk about how the program behaves and what it should do. They will test their program with outside users. They will look back at their work to make sure it meet all the requirements and put it in a prototype. This will allow the developers to make changes while running the framework. . | Now for the test. This might be the final step, but testing occurs during every step of the development process. Testing occurs on different levels including micro and macro. Finally, developers revisit and refine their program based on what was shown after the test, feedback provided from users, and their reflection on what they wanted the program to do. . | .

Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by Brainstorming (draw on investigation) | Storyboarding the program | Planning user experience | Laying out the user interface | Organizing into modules | Develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that Describe how a program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the Micro level | Macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . . When does documentation happen? (Video 3) . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | Efficiency of overall programming process | Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | Programmers’ response to bugs | How to make comments in different languages: Python (#) | Java (// - single line; /* */ - multiple lines; /** **/ - multiple line documentation) | Javascript, C/C++, Swift - also use something similar to Java | XML/HTML (&lt;!-- --&gt;) | Applescript/Pascal (* *) | block-based languages use pop-outs for comments | . | . .

            "title": "YouTube Quiz",
            "content": "Initial Idea . My Quiz was based on the extremely popular video sharing website known as YouTube. It contains 3 multiple-choice questions. . Bold = correct answer . Q1: What is the most disliked video on YouTube? . A: Everyday Bro B: So Sorry C: YouTube Rewind 2018 D: Egg Video . Q2: Where does the first video on YouTube take place? . A: Eiffel Tower B: San Diego Zoo C: Statue of Liberty D: Bronx Zoo . Q3: What is the most viewed video on YouTube? . A: Gangnam Style B: Baby Shark C: Hello D: Despacito . My Original Code . This is what I used to first start my quiz. It worked well but it didn&#39;t have a &quot;Incorrect&quot; screen that it redirected to if there was a question that was answered incorrectly. It was also not efficient. It had a &quot;onEvent&quot; block for every possible answer so it was messy and inefficient. . var score = 0; var question = 0; console.log(score); console.log(&quot;question: &quot; + question); onEvent(&quot;StartButton&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(change_screen) { setScreen(&quot;Question1Screen&quot;); question = question + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); question = question + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); question = question + 1; setText(&quot;text_area2&quot;, &quot;You answered &quot; + (score + &quot;/3 questions correctly!&quot;)); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function( ) { var Question2answer = getText(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;); if (Question2answer == &quot;The San Diego Zoo&quot;) { score = score + 1; setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); console.log(score); question = question + 1; } else { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); console.log(score); question = question + 1; } }); . My Final Code . This is my final code. I added some If/Else Statements to get rid of most of the clutter. I also added Incorrect Screens for when you get a question wrong. . order = [&quot;Question1Screen&quot;, &quot;Question2Screen&quot;, &quot;Question3Screen&quot;, &quot;finalscreen&quot;] // Functions function Incorrect_Next_Question() { onEvent(&quot;nextquestion&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { questions = questions + 1; setScreen(order[questions]) }); } // Variables var questions = 0 var score = 0; console.log(score); onEvent(&quot;StartButton&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(change_screen) { setScreen(&quot;Question1Screen&quot;); // Question 1 Code onEvent(&quot;Dislike3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); order = order + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); // Question 2 Code onEvent(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function( ) { var Question2answer = getText(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;); if (Question2answer == &quot;The San Diego Zoo&quot;) { score = score + 1; setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); order = order + 1; console.log(score); } else { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() console.log(score); } }); // Question 3 Code onEvent(&quot;Viewed2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); score = score + 1; if (score == 3) { setText(&quot;Encouragement&quot;, &quot;Wow, you got a perfect score!&quot;); } else { if (score == 2) { setText(&quot;Encouragement&quot;, &quot;Almost there.

Keep trying to get 3/3!&quot;); } else { if (score &lt;= 1) { setText(&quot;Encouragement&quot;, &quot;Oops, I think you made a few mistakes.&quot;); } } } }); }); . Challenges I faced . I couldn&#39;t figure out how to use the or statements | I wasn&#39;t able to add radio buttons because they took too many commands to set up properly | I couldn&#39;t figure out how to copy code while it was in block form. | . Ways I could further improve my quiz . I could add background sound and add sounds when you answer questions correctly or incorrectly. | I could add transitions between questions. | I could add more questions but the assignment limited me to only 3. | .",

            "content": "Soham Kamat . Mrs. James . HSE3: Period 4 . 26 August 2022 . How to be Happy . CLAIM: The two most contributing factors of happiness are doing what you love and believing in yourself. . One of the most contributing factors of happiness is doing what you love. In the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, the narrator talks about how happiness is proven by people who do what they love. Andy Wimmer was a German Banker who used to value money a lot. He bought many expensive clothes and cars and lived life lavishly. However, this did not bring much joy and he decided to quit his job and help others. He ended up going to Kolkata and started volunteering at Mother Theresa’s Home for the Destitute and Dying. He still volunteers there to this day because helping others makes him happy. In addition, in the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, happiness is shown by people who enjoy what they do and do what they enjoy. Ronaldo Fadul is a surfer who lives in a small town in Brazil. He lives there with his family because he loves surfing all day. Ronaldo also helps injured birds. He helps mend their wings and helps them become healthy. Surfing and helping these birds make him happy because he loves doing these activities. Conclusively, I believe doing things that make you happy is one of the best ways to stay happy and enjoy life at the same time. . Another one of the most contributing factors of happiness is believing in yourself. A time that I was happy was when I believed in myself and I accomplished a goal because of it. A few days ago, I got an assignment for AP Computer Science Principles. I had to set up a website using the given instructions. However I had some issues that the teacher could not help me with. I spent a few days working really late into the night attempting to fix the problems I was encountering. I never gave up and kept trying to find a solution to these issues. After a few days of trying, I found a solution. In addition, in the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, we are introduced to Melissa Moody, a person who believed in herself and got herself out of depression. Melissa Moody was a very pretty woman who lived on her family’s land. One day, she had an argument with her sister in law and it ended up with the sister in law running Melissa over with her car. Melissa’s pretty facial features were ruined and she could not communicate for months. She thought about suicide and decided to not do it to help her kids who were still young. She is now comfortable with her face and helps other people feel better after their accidents. In conclusion, there are many ways to be happy but the main ways to achieve this are to believe in yourself and do things that you enjoy. .",

            "content": "Today, after class, we had a panel of CS alumni students who had a Q &amp;A about how Computer Science helps with college and how it is useful in many fields other than CS. We learned many things such as how the course helps a lot with learning how to solve real world problems and how it can be applied to other majors other than CS. An example they gave was that you could make a script to help copy and paste things from a document to a spreadsheet. Another thing we learned was that finding the motivation to learn CS is hard at first because Project Based Learning is hard to understand at first and there is always someone better at CS than you. However, once you get the hang of the class, it becomes easier to understand and follow. Also, if you ever get stuck, you can always use google to help find a solution. Making sure you have a plan and don’t cut corners is hard but really important for success in this subject. Remember, not everyone has the same experience and if you think you aren’t very good, you could study independently to get better. Finding the motivation to learn CS is hard at first but it is really fun later. As one of the panelists said, “Don’t worry about how the ‘Steve Jobs’ of the world are doing. Focus on yourself and learn how to get better.” In summary, learning CS is very difficult at the start but gets easier as you progress through the course. However, if you have the willingness and motivation, you can do anything. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
