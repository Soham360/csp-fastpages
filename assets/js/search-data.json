Categories of Innovations include Applications (games, social media, productivity), Physical Devices (computers, tablets, smart “things”), Systems (E-commerce, email). | You want to think about some guiding questions when you think about purpose: Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not before? | . | . Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 2 . Computer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text). | Programs are mostly event-driven –&gt; events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program | Input affects output of a program | Outputs can be visual, audio, tactile (touch/feel like vibrations), text | . Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 3 . A program (aka software) is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment | . | Describing code segments: Simply state what it does | Include what it does/how it does it | . | . Collegeboard Quiz . I took the Program Function and Purpose Quiz MCQ. . Hacks . My group’s final project idea is to create Flash cards to help us study with various vocab/questions. The flash cards will be in the format where it asks you a question and you will have a textbox to input your answer. Then it will show you the actual answer of the question and you can compare your questions. . It is for an educational purpose because it’ll help us develop our coding vocabulary. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as ways to test your knowledge. . This project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because it helps with studying which is very important to people’s lives. . This project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission: . Program Purpose and Function The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can study for a subject. | . | Data Abstraction Information such as the questions and answers will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction. | . | Managing Complexity The list will have to contain the items to display. | . | Procedural Abstraction The procedures will involve creating questions and answers for those questions. | . | Algorithm Implementation Randomizing questions will require an algorithmn. | . | Testing There can be functions such as “quizes” that need to call different values from different places. | . |",

            "content": "Initial Idea . My Quiz was based on the extremely popular video sharing website known as YouTube. It contains 3 multiple-choice questions. . Bold = correct answer . Q1: What is the most disliked video on YouTube? . A: Everyday Bro B: So Sorry C: YouTube Rewind 2018 D: Egg Video . Q2: Where does the first video on YouTube take place? . A: Eiffel Tower B: San Diego Zoo C: Statue of Liberty D: Bronx Zoo . Q3: What is the most viewed video on YouTube? . A: Gangnam Style B: Baby Shark C: Hello D: Despacito . My Original Code . This is what I used to first start my quiz. It worked well but it didn&#39;t have a &quot;Incorrect&quot; screen that it redirected to if there was a question that was answered incorrectly. It was also not efficient. It had a &quot;onEvent&quot; block for every possible answer so it was messy and inefficient. . var score = 0; var question = 0; console.log(score); console.log(&quot;question: &quot; + question); onEvent(&quot;StartButton&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(change_screen) { setScreen(&quot;Question1Screen&quot;); question = question + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); question = question + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); question = question + 1; setText(&quot;text_area2&quot;, &quot;You answered &quot; + (score + &quot;/3 questions correctly!&quot;)); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Viewed4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function( ) { var Question2answer = getText(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;); if (Question2answer == &quot;The San Diego Zoo&quot;) { score = score + 1; setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); console.log(score); question = question + 1; } else { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); console.log(score); question = question + 1; } }); . My Final Code . This is my final code. I added some If/Else Statements to get rid of most of the clutter. I also added Incorrect Screens for when you get a question wrong. . order = [&quot;Question1Screen&quot;, &quot;Question2Screen&quot;, &quot;Question3Screen&quot;, &quot;finalscreen&quot;] // Functions function Incorrect_Next_Question() { onEvent(&quot;nextquestion&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { questions = questions + 1; setScreen(order[questions]) }); } // Variables var questions = 0 var score = 0; console.log(score); onEvent(&quot;StartButton&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(change_screen) { setScreen(&quot;Question1Screen&quot;); // Question 1 Code onEvent(&quot;Dislike3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;Question2Screen&quot;); score = score + 1; console.log(score); order = order + 1; }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); onEvent(&quot;Dislike4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() }); // Question 2 Code onEvent(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function( ) { var Question2answer = getText(&quot;Question2Answers&quot;); if (Question2answer == &quot;The San Diego Zoo&quot;) { score = score + 1; setScreen(&quot;Question3Screen&quot;); order = order + 1; console.log(score); } else { setScreen(&quot;IncorrectScreen&quot;); Incorrect_Next_Question() console.log(score); } }); // Question 3 Code onEvent(&quot;Viewed2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;finalscreen&quot;); score = score + 1; if (score == 3) { setText(&quot;Encouragement&quot;, &quot;Wow, you got a perfect score!&quot;); } else { if (score == 2) { setText(&quot;Encouragement&quot;, &quot;Almost there.

CLAIM: The two most contributing factors of happiness are doing what you love and believing in yourself. . One of the most contributing factors of happiness is doing what you love. In the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, the narrator talks about how happiness is proven by people who do what they love. Andy Wimmer was a German Banker who used to value money a lot. He bought many expensive clothes and cars and lived life lavishly. However, this did not bring much joy and he decided to quit his job and help others. He ended up going to Kolkata and started volunteering at Mother Theresa’s Home for the Destitute and Dying. He still volunteers there to this day because helping others makes him happy. In addition, in the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, happiness is shown by people who enjoy what they do and do what they enjoy. Ronaldo Fadul is a surfer who lives in a small town in Brazil. He lives there with his family because he loves surfing all day. Ronaldo also helps injured birds. He helps mend their wings and helps them become healthy. Surfing and helping these birds make him happy because he loves doing these activities. Conclusively, I believe doing things that make you happy is one of the best ways to stay happy and enjoy life at the same time. . Another one of the most contributing factors of happiness is believing in yourself. A time that I was happy was when I believed in myself and I accomplished a goal because of it. A few days ago, I got an assignment for AP Computer Science Principles. I had to set up a website using the given instructions. However I had some issues that the teacher could not help me with. I spent a few days working really late into the night attempting to fix the problems I was encountering. I never gave up and kept trying to find a solution to these issues. After a few days of trying, I found a solution. In addition, in the Happy Documentary by Roko Belic, we are introduced to Melissa Moody, a person who believed in herself and got herself out of depression. Melissa Moody was a very pretty woman who lived on her family’s land. One day, she had an argument with her sister in law and it ended up with the sister in law running Melissa over with her car. Melissa’s pretty facial features were ruined and she could not communicate for months. She thought about suicide and decided to not do it to help her kids who were still young. She is now comfortable with her face and helps other people feel better after their accidents. In conclusion, there are many ways to be happy but the main ways to achieve this are to believe in yourself and do things that you enjoy. .",

We learned many things such as how the course helps a lot with learning how to solve real world problems and how it can be applied to other majors other than CS. An example they gave was that you could make a script to help copy and paste things from a document to a spreadsheet. Another thing we learned was that finding the motivation to learn CS is hard at first because Project Based Learning is hard to understand at first and there is always someone better at CS than you. However, once you get the hang of the class, it becomes easier to understand and follow. Also, if you ever get stuck, you can always use google to help find a solution. Making sure you have a plan and don’t cut corners is hard but really important for success in this subject. Remember, not everyone has the same experience and if you think you aren’t very good, you could study independently to get better. Finding the motivation to learn CS is hard at first but it is really fun later. As one of the panelists said, “Don’t worry about how the ‘Steve Jobs’ of the world are doing. Focus on yourself and learn how to get better.” In summary, learning CS is very difficult at the start but gets easier as you progress through the course. However, if you have the willingness and motivation, you can do anything. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
