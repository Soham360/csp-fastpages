<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h2>
<p>There were a lot of questions on collaboration and the Internet. There were also more questions about protocols and data transmissions. However, most of the problems were pseudocode where you are given a block of code and asked for the output or an error in the code. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Mostly they were easy for me because I have prior programming knowledge but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-missed">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-missed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I missed</h2>
<p>I missed 4 questions. One of the questions I got wrong was due to a silly mistake. In that question, I had to add 8 with 4 and 4 and somehow got 12. I also missed couple questions because I just forgot some information on the internet and another simple problem. The last question I got wrong was due to me not realizing an integer could be a string.</p>

<p>The questions I missed were Question 17, Question , Question , and Question .</p>

<h3 id="question-17">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-17" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 17</h3>
<p>Q: Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet?</p>

<p>A: Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.
B: Open protocols ensure that all data transmission on the Internet is kept secure.
C: Open protocols ensure that all Internet users are provided connections with equal bandwidth. (Selected, remembered something about equal/standard so I clicked this)
<strong>D: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.</strong></p>

<h3 id="question-23">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-23" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 23</h3>
<p>Q: The position of a runner in a race is a type of analog data. The runner’s position is tracked using sensors. Which of the following best describes how the position of the runner is represented digitally?</p>

<p>A: The position of the runner is determined by calculating the time difference between the start and the end of the race and making an estimation based on the runner’s average speed. (Selected, guessed this question)
B: The position of the runner is measured and rounded to either 0 or 1 depending on whether the runner is closer to the starting line or closer to the finish line.
C: The position of the runner is predicted using a model based on performance data captured from previous races.
<strong>D: The position of the runner is sampled at regular intervals to approximate the real-word position, and a sequence of bits is used to represent each sample.</strong></p>

<h3 id="question-39">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-39" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 39</h3>
<p>Q: The list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wordList</code> contains a list of 10 string values. Which of the following is a valid index for the list?</p>

<p>A: -1
B: “hello” (Selected, thought hello was the only string)
C: 2.5
<strong>D: 4</strong></p>

<h3 id="question-42">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-42" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 42</h3>
<p>Q: Consider the following code segment.
<img src="/csp-fastpages/images/problem.png" alt=""> What is the value of sum after the code segment is executed?</p>

<p>A: 12 (Selected, messed up my math)
B: 14
<strong>C: 16</strong>
D: 18</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-can-do-better" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I can do better</h2>
<p>Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully and rechecking my answers after I’m done. I also have to remember to study the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the results of my Trimester 1 Final on Collegeboard.
