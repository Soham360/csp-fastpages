<p>The most important skill that you have is continuous learning.</p>

<h2 id="summary">
<a class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Kathyleen Beveridge and Kris Porter are two computer scientists who used to work at Qualcomm with Mr. Mortensen. They talked about their experiences and the projects they’ve worked on. They gave some recommendations on how to be a better Computer Scientist. They ended the seminar with a few questions from the audience.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h2>

<p>Today I learned that learning to code should not be your first priority. Your first priority is to be able to learn and grow from your mistakes. You have to be able to adapt and be flexible. Kathyleen Beveridge proved that you can adapt and be flexible when she transitioned from a job as a Computer Scientist to a job at a Biology based company. I think most of the lessons talked about during the lecture can be applied to many things in life.</p>
