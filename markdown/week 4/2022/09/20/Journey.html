<p>My Computer Science Journey
I began my coding journey in 6th grade as part of a coding class. We would use block coding in scratch for a very basic understanding of coding. Then for the next few years, I learned Python and how it works. However, I stopped learning it for a few years and forgot most of the material, unfortunately. A major hobby that I had found during that time was learning about computers and how they worked. THis hobby helped me learn the software side of the computers based on the hardware side. So far in this class, I’ve learned lots of new things, such as, how to set up my own perosnal blog, how to code in JavaScript,, etc.</p>
