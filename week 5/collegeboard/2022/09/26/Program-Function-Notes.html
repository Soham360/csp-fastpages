<ul>
  <li>You want to think about some guiding questions when you think about purpose:
    <ul>
      <li>Why does the computing innovation exist?</li>
      <li>What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?</li>
      <li>What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not before?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Categories of Innovations include Applications (games, social media, productivity), Physical Devices (computers, tablets, smart “things”), Systems (E-commerce, email).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Computer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text).</li>
  <li>Input affects output of a program</li>
  <li>Outputs can be visual, audio, tactile (touch/feel like vibrations), text</li>
  <li>Programs are mostly event-driven –&gt; events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Describing code segments:
    <ul>
      <li>Simply state what it does</li>
      <li>Include what it does/how it does it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A program (aka software) is a collection of statements.
    <ul>
      <li>A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My group’s final project idea is to create Flash cards to help us study with various vocab/questions. The flash cards will be in the format where it asks you a question and you will have a textbox to input your answer. Then it will show you the actual answer of the question and you can compare your questions.</p>

<p>It is for an educational purpose because it’ll help us develop our coding vocabulary. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as ways to test your knowledge.</p>

<p>This project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because it helps with studying which is very important to people’s lives.</p>

<p>This project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Program Purpose and Function
    <ul>
      <li>The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can study for a subject.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>Information such as the questions and answers will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managing Complexity
    <ul>
      <li>The list will have to contain the items to display.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Procedural Abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>The procedures will involve creating questions and answers for those questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Algorithm Implementation
    <ul>
      <li>Randomizing questions will require an algorithmn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing
    <ul>
      <li>There can be functions such as “quizes” that need to call different values from different places.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
